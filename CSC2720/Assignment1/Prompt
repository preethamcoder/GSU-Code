CSc 2720 - Data Structures: Assignment 1
 [100 points]

How to Submit:

Turn the .java file in Folder Assignment 1 in iCollege no later than 11:00 p.m. ET on 01/27/2021

Notes:

1.	Do not use any library for matrix multiplication.

2.	Always use comments to explain your program.

3.	No copying allowed. If it is found that students copy from each other, all of these programs will get 0.

4.	You must use matrix.java as the program name; otherwise, you will lose 10%.

Requirements:

You are to write a program name matrix.java that makes the dot products of 2 arrays.

1. Your program should prompt the user for the dimensions of the two squares matrices, making sure that the user input is equal to 50.

2.	If the above is not met, prompt the user for a new value.

3.	Now generate random integer numbers (ranging from 0 to 50) to fill both matrices.

4.	Display these two matrices on the screen.

5.	Multiply the two matrices and display the result on the screen.

6.	Insert a clock to see how long it would take to multiply these two matrices and display the time (with a message to this effect).

7.	Prompt the user asking if they want to repeat the program.
