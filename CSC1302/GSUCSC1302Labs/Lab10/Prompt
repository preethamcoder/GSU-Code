1.	Write a program that 
a.	Calls a method that performs sequential search. The method accepts two parameters: an array of integers and an integer. It returns the index of the integer in the array if it is found else it returns-1.

b.	Calls another method that takes two parameters, an integer and a sorted integer array. The call should perform binary search and should return the index of the integer in the array if found and should return -(insertionPoint+ 1) if the number is not found. Print out the index in the main method.

c.	Calls a third method that performs binary search recursively. It should take 4 parameters: 3 integers and a sorted array of integers. It should return the index of the element if found, if not then it should return -1.
